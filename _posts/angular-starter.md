excerpt: "I wanted to get my feet wet with Angular development, since I have an interview on Monday where Angular is their javascript framework of choice. I learned the angular way on how to create components, create interfaces, add inputs to components, add property binding to components, add dynamic values to templates, use *ngFor to loop through data in templates, use Angular services, add routing, integrate Angular forms, add search functionality, and how to add HTTP communication."

I wanted to get my feet wet with Angular development, since I have an interview on Monday where Angular is their javascript framework of choice. I learned the angular way on how to create components, create interfaces, add inputs to components, add property binding to components, add dynamic values to templates, use *ngFor to loop through data in templates, use Angular services, add routing, integrate Angular forms, add search functionality, and how to add HTTP communication (although for simplicity purposes, will leave it static for now since I don't want to build out the API portion just yet).

The app utilizes core Angular functionality, such as routing, passing data to and from components via services, TypeScript decorators and interfaces, and much more. I think Angular is a great framework, as it's tooling helps with component customization, dependency injection, data binding, testing, comprehensiveness, and browser compatibility, to name a few things. The team at Google helps maintain a suite of tools, API's, and libraries to simplify and streamline the development workflow. Angular gives a solid platform on which to build fast, reliable applications that scale the size of development teams and the size of the codebase. 

This was a fun way to start developing with Angular! :)
